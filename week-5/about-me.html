			<h2>Things about me personally.</h2>
			<p>
			Anyone driving slower than me on the freeway needs to be more considerate of others. Anyone driving faster than me needs learn to manage their time better.

			<h2>Things about me professionally.</h2>
			<p>Trying to switch careers, from CNC Machining to Web Developer/Programmer. I'm am currently actively studying HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
			<p>JS is mostly on hold while I focus more on the powers of CSS 3, but I am still anxiously intrigued by it. It's definittely bigger next step into the world of programming.
				With all of the versatility of JS, I'm surprised it's not more popular, and there's an entire arsenal of other languages that seem serve a similar purpose. Experience will help refine these initial impressions.
				Indeed, we're all human. We go to great lengths to avoid improvising and always have an abundance of tools.</p>

			<h2>Academic tendencies.</h2>
			<p>
				I never did well in school when I was growing up. So far I'm doing okay in college. I'm finally putting my stubborness to good use.

			Here's a few simple bits about me.
			</h2>

			<ul>
			 <li>Love computers. Always have. But I've always been more of a hardware type. Trying very hard to change that.</li>
			 <li><a href="https://www.microcenter.com">I Did all my computer shopping here.</a> <a href="https://www.newegg.com">Or here.</a>
				 Building gaming PCs was a passion of mine ever since I tore out that old modem and upgraded to 56k.</li>
			 <li>I like the idea of being a computer programmer. Websites or apps. Maybe someday games, who knows. Technology should makes people's lives more enjoyable.</li>
			 <li>I'm trying to start a new career. My current one requires me to be precise. I thought that would transfer over to programming easily.</li>
			 <li>It's harder than I thought.</li>
			 <li>It's also more fun than I thought it would be.</li>
			</ul>
