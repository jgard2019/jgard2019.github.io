        <h3>The project continues...</h3>
        <p>Starting October 20th 2019, this site will trace the evolution of what we're learning in BIT 112 Web Authoring class.</p>

        <h2>Super sweet original main page content here.</h2>
        <p>The best time to start something new is two weeks ago. But I won't let that distract me from the notion that I'm going to miss all of this coding freedom 5 years from now.
          Nothing here has to be anything. It's an assignment, sure, but still about 98% choice. Optional. Interchangable.
          One day when I get paid to develop these things, I know I'll mostly be sticking close to the red-lines and composites that are imported from some other departments.
          The beauty is that if I ever want to make something of my own, it'll be an easy itch to scratch.</p>
