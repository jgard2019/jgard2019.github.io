		<h1>About Josh G.</h1>

		<section>
			<h2>Things about me personally.
			</h2>
			<p>
			Definitely missed the part where I was supposed to be writing things about myself inbetween everything else that's been going on.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Things about me professionally.</h2>
			<p>
				I could write all day about my job. The lingo, the scapped parts, the dirty enviroment and the zombie mentality of sleep deprived machinists.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Things about my drinking habits.</h2>
			<p>
				I drink, but I'm not much of a drinker. Costco has a great wine-cocktail margarita that I buy each week. If it gets cold enough, I sip on single malt, neat, by the fire.

			<h2>
			Here's a few simple bits about me.
			</h2>

			<ul>
			 <li>Love computers. Always have. But I've always been more of a hardware type. Trying very hard to change that.</li>
			 <li><a href="https://www.microcenter.com">I Did all my computer shopping here.</a> <a href="https://www.newegg.com">Or here.</a> Building gaming PCs was a passion of mine ever since I tore out that old modem and upgraded to 56k.</li>
			 <li>I like the idea of being a computer programmer. Websites or apps. Maybe someday games, who knows. Technology should makes people's lives more enjoyable.</li>
			 <li>I'm trying to start a new career. My current one requires me to be precise. I thought that would transfer over to programming easily.</li>
			 <li>It's harder than I thought.</li>
			 <li>It's also more fun than I thought it would be.</li>
			 <li>I have two dogs. They're spoiled beyond belief.</li>
			</ul>
