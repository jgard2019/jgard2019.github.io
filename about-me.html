			Here's a few simple bits about me.
		</p>

			<ul>
			 <li>Love computers. Always have. But I've always been more of a hardware type. Trying very hard to change that.</li>
			 <li><a href="https://www.microcenter.com">I Did all my computer shopping here.</a> <a href="https://www.newegg.com">Or here.</a> Building gaming PCs was a passion of mine ever since I tore out that old modem and upgraded to 56k.</li>
			 <li>I like the idea of being a computer programmer. Websites or apps. Maybe someday games, who knows. Technology should makes people's lives more enjoyable.</li>
			 <li>I'm trying to start a new career. My current one requires me to be precise. I thought that would transfer over to programming easily.</li>
			 <li>It's harder than I thought.</li>
			 <li>It's also more fun than I thought it would be.</li>
			 <li>I have two dogs. They're spoiled beyond belief.</li>
			</ul>
