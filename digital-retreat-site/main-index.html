          <p>This is the Digital Retreat. An unlimited amount of space for creation, rememberance, random thoughts and as many important and
            interesting pictures as I can manage to put here. We are our memories. We are the things we've learned and experienced in our lives. But I
            have a habit of being forgetful. This place will help me remember again and again.</p>
            <p>It's also my place to publish and test live web projects since that seems to be my new calling. It isn't much yet, but I
            hope that in a few years it'll be jam-packed full of interesting ideas and beautiful coded creations. </p>

          <h2>Journal</h2><p>This is where I empty out my brain if it gets too full. I highly encourage everyone to have a similar strategy.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="grid-item-2"><h2>Prose</h2>
          <p>If I wanted to write something that mostly only makes sense to me, this is where it goes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item-2"><h2>Reviews</h2>
          <p>I am jam packed full of opinions and not enough people to listen. It helps to write about it all.</p>

            <p>That's my dog. One of two. His name is Kopi. We spoiled the living shit out of him. I only half regret it though. He keeps my feet warm.</p>
