    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <h3>How do search engines work?</h3>

      <p>Search engines crawl (visit) bazillions of pages using web crawlers (seems to be a computer program). Seach engines like google
       have many different webcrawlers, some for specific purposes.</p>

       <p>The search engine indexes the site (makes a copy of the site and stores it)</p>

       <p>Search engines use algorithms to analyse the web , then scan for a user's search requests</p>

       <p>Relavent results are returned to the users who are using the search engine.</p>

    <h3>Why do different search engines give different ranking to websites?</h3>
      <p>The algorithms that different search engines use are different for each engine. So, the interpretation of the indexed data will be
      different from S.E. to S.E. </p>

    <h3>What is a meta tag? What is the purpose for keyword and description meta tags?</h3>
      <p>"It's information about data". In my head, I think of it as a summary of settings and descriptions for a web page. Meta tags range from
      complex to very simple (Like "title", and "author" that go into  name attribute in a meta tag). The keywords and description are fairly straightforward -
      give words that are relevant to the content of this page. I'd pair this with the "description" as well. For example:</p>
      <p> &lt;meta name="keywords" content="Report, Search Engine Rankings, College Homework, Assignment, HTML practice" &gt;</p>
      <p> &lt;meta name="description" content="This is a report on Search Engine Rankings. It's an assignment for a college class." &gt;</p>

    <h3>Why might you include meta tags in your pages? Do meta tags make your pages more easily searchable to improve its ranking?</h3>
      <p>From what I've read, keywords and descriptions are a factor that help with website rankings and visability. They're definitely not the only thing the algorithms take into consideration.
      However, just based on my experience with search engines throughout my life, I can tell you that keywords used to play a much, much bigger role than they do now. Search engines were much easier to fool back in the mid 1990's. </p>

    <h3>What are several ways that you can publicize your personal website project and make it more visable on the web?</h3>
      <p>Here are a few tips I found that claim to be beneficial for better visibility by search engines.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>words matter. Be it in your meta tags or the content of your website. I believe it all counts.</li>
          <li>titles matter! Search engines also factor in the proper use of your HTML semantics.</li>
          <li>words in links matter, More HTML semantics, but this also helps with accessibility, which, as you guessed, is also a factor. </li>
          <li>links between websites matter</li>
          <li>'Back links!' links to YOUR SITE on other websites are good for your ranking</li>
          <li>Links to your site from social media is good for your ranking (back links)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>The Take Away</h3>
      <p>The grading never stops. The SE algorithms are watching you. So, write good code. Make it accessible. Use the mark up how it was intended to be used, then post some good quality content,
      and you'll rank well enough if you're being sought out. </p>
