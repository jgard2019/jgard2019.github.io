        <h2>What is an internet domain name?</h2>
          <p>Basically, it's a name used to identify the IP address of the desired website. Every computer and server on the internet has at least one IP address.</p>

        <h2>Why are domain names so important on the web?</h2>
          <p>Each domain name must be unique. It's important so that people can remember where to find you. It's a lot easier to remember www.google.com instead of 2607:f8b0:400a:808::2004 (Google has a lot of IP addresses.)</p>

        <h2>Why do domain names have to be unique?</h2>
          <p>The domain names are assigned directly to the IP addresses. If you were to misspell the domain name in your browser address, you'd likely be taken nowhere, or to the wrong site. Computers require precision.</p>

        <h2>What does it mean to register a domain name?</h2>
          <p>Once you register a domain name with an official registrar, that domain name belongs to you (or a company). No one else can use it without your permission. Records of the owner of the domain are kept by the registrar and Top Level Domain Registries.</p>

        <h2>If you wanted a domain name that is already taken, how could you get it?</h2>
          <p>You'd have to contact the owner of the domain and either negotiate a price and purchase it, or rent it from them.</p>
