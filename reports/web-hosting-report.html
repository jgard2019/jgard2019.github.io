    <h2>Research Questions:</h2>
    <h3>What is a web server? Would would you need one?</h3>
    <p>According to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server">Mozilla,</a>
      ..."a web server can refer to hardware, software, or both of them working together." A server is (usually) a powerful computer dedicated to a few very specific tasks.
       Web servers host websites, and harbor all of the software and hardware necessary to perform that task. Why would you need a web server? That depends, but generally speaking, it would be far more reliable to host
     your website on a computer that's dedicated to hosting websites. It would have the software, hardware, and bandwidth necessary to serve many clients simultaneously. </p>

    <h3>Explain why getting a domain name is not enough to put your site up on the web.</h3>
    <p>Getting and registering a domain name only allows you to use the domain name, and keeps anyone else from using it without your permission.
       To put your website up on the web, you'd still need to store the website's content on a server somewhere with the domain name applied to the address. </p>

    <h3>What service does a website hosting company provide?</h3>
    <p> They all mostly provide the same general things.
    <ul>
      <li>Access to your site's content, and the bandwidth necessary for the site's traffic.</li>
      <li>File storage and back-up for the site's content (I can't imagine Youtube's storage needs.)</li>
      <li>Most providers boast a certain level of online security from hackers.</li>
      <li>Most providers offer support for easy site design and functionality for those who might need it.</li>
      <li>I'm seeing more and more website analytics everywhere I go, helpful if you want to track where your visiters are clicking and spending their time on your site.</li>
      <li>Most providers will provide you with a unique e-mail address and service as well. (meee@uniquebusiness.com)</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>What are the most important characteristics to look for in selecting a good web hosting company?</h3>
    <p>What's most important is good value for the services you need without too many services you don't need.
       I'm going to build a personal site, and maybe eventually use it to host a portfolio. I don't need a tremendous amount of bandwidth or even storage.
      Many web hosting companies also provide domain registration as well as hosting, which is convienient for small sites like mine.</p>

    <h3>Research companies that provide website hosting plans. On average what is the price range (per month) for hosting a website?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>godaddy.com Basic plan for hosting: $5.99/mo, then $8.99 when you renew.</li>
      <li>bluehost.com Basic plan for $2.95/mo (doesn't seem to mention that as a starter rate)</li>
      <li>dreamhost.com Basic plan $2.59/mo</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Between those, looks like the average is around 4$ per month. I've read from multiple places (not from the webhosts themselves)
       that you generally get what you pay for. Not all of these basic plans are created equally. Some "basic" plans provide far more than
        just web hosting.</p>

    <h3>What are the most important features for you when reviewing a hosting plan?</h3>
    <p>What's most important for me is stability, if my needs don't change, I dont want my plans or prices to change drastically over time.
       Also, upgradability, if I decide to increase my online needs, the last thing I would want to do is shop around for a new webhost.
      I'd want to simply upgrade with my current host (assuming of course, their service has been hassle free.)</p>
