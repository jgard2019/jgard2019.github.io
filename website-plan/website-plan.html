    <h1>Website Plan</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Website Topic and Title</h2>
      <p>The Title of this website project will be "Digital Retreat"</p>
      <h2>Target audience is as follows:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Primarily Myself</li>
          <li>Close friends</li>
          <li>Some Family</li>
          <li>Anyone who happens to stumble upon my random writing and articles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to serve as a repository for my thoughts, opinions, and remembrance.
          It is mainly meant to serve as a personal digital journal.</p>
        <h2>Comparable Sites</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.blogger.com">www.blogger.com</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.livejournal.com">www.livejournal.com</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com">www.tumblr.com</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Main Site Content</h2>
        <p>The majority of the content of this site will include:
          <ul>
            <li>Mostly writing, journaling, prose, ramblings</li>
            <li>Photographs I consider to be significant, along with the stories behind them</li>
            <li>Writing about opinions and reviews on things like cars and technology</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Site Personality</h2>
        <p>Obviously a website like this will have a lot of personality.
          It will eventually serve as a showcase for my web-development skill and styles.
          I personally can't imagine how anyone learns how to code websites or any computer software without having some level of passion for this type of work.
          I've mentioned it before in one of my earlier web-projects in this class:
          There won't always be total freedom of design and creation when this becomes a profession.
          But there's nothing stopping me from staying up late one night, or getting up early one morning to sit and create something.
          This site should serve as my own personal creative space.
          And at the points where I don't have time to upkeep this as much as I'd like, it will serve as a reference to how I used to write code and design websites.
          So the website personality will be catered to:
        <ul>
          <li>Highly legible main content</li>
          <li>Minimal Navigation</li>
          <li>Emphasis on beautiful web design, but also minimalistic or at least not gaudy</li>
          <li>Attention to little subtle details, like someone, you know, cares about it</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>Designing with Mobile in mind, always.
          I wouldn't create a site that I personally can't access anywhere.
          So there should not be issues with loading this website on older browsers and slower internet connections.
